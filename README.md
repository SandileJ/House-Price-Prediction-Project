# House-Price-Prediction-Project
Project Overview
This project aims to predict the sale price of houses based on the lot area using machine learning techniques. By utilizing a simple dataset of house sales, the goal is to build a regression model that can accurately predict the price based on the size of the property.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains two features:

LotArea: The area of the property in square feet/meters.
SalePrice: The sale price of the house in the local currency.
The dataset is stored in the file house_price_by_area.csv.

Problem Statement
Real estate pricing is a critical component of the housing market, and accurate pricing models can benefit homeowners, real estate agents, and buyers. This project seeks to predict house prices based solely on the lot size, providing an introductory framework for simple regression modeling.

Project Pipeline
Data Exploration: Explore the dataset to understand its structure and identify any patterns.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data by scaling and splitting it into training and testing sets.
Modeling: Train a linear regression model to predict house prices based on lot area.
Evaluation: Assess the model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
Technologies Used
Python: Main programming language
Pandas: For data loading and manipulation
NumPy: For numerical computations
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization
Scikit-learn: For machine learning and evaluation
